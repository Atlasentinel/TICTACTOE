Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game repository! This project implements a simple interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game using React.

## Features

- **Player Names:** Customize player names before starting the game.
- **Turn-Based Play:** Alternate turns between two players ('❤️' and '☢️').
- **Winning Condition:** Automatically detects and announces when a player wins.
- **Match Draw:** Declares a draw when all cells are filled without a winner.
- **LocalStorage:** Stores player names locally for a personalized experience.
- **Sound Effects:** Plays a sound effect each time a move is made.

## How to Play

1. **Setup:**
   - Enter player names in the input fields provided.
   - Click on the player name inputs to set or change names.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - Start by clicking on any cell in the 3x3 grid to place your mark ('❤️' or '☢️').
   - The game alternates turns automatically between players.
   - The game board updates in real-time with each move.

3. **Winning:**
   - The game checks after each move for a winning condition (three consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonal).
   - If a player wins, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the game board resets for a new game.

4. **Draw:**
   - If all cells are filled and no player has three consecutive marks, the game declares a draw.

5. **Reset:**
   - To start a new game with the same player names, refresh the page or click the refresh icon.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Programming language for functionality and logic.
